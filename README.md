# Pomodoro Discord Bot

This Discord bot was developed as a personal project aimed at honing my programming and bot design skills. Additionally, I created it for my own benefit, as the Pomodoro technique is a tool I frequently employ in both my work and studies. It helps me maintain focus and enhance productivity by segmenting my time into work sessions and short breaks. This bot is a digital embodiment of that technique, integrated directly into Discord for ease of use in my daily routine. Importantly, all features have been translated into Spanish, ensuring that my friends can also utilize and benefit from it.
